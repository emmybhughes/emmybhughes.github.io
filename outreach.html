    <p> I love participating in the Atlanta Science Festival! In 2023, I helped crew the ExplOrigins booth, and had the opportunity to talk about the various scales of space. In 2024, I set up a spectroscopy game to teach kids about how scientists learn information from “squiggly lines”. Fingers crossed for a new generation of spectroscopists!!
      <br> <br>
I recently presented on the geologic history of Mars to high school students at David Stoddard School in Clinton, British Columbia, and also gave a spectroscopy demo. I was there with a multi-institutional team of researchers who described different aspects of remote sensing, astrobiology, and more! Students were very excited to see how different materials appear in visible and near infrared light! 
<br><br>
      I’ve also edited and expanded multiple Wikipedia articles. I’ve expanded the Wikipedia article for the Goldich Dissolution Series, which you can find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldich_dissolution_series" target="_blank">here</a>. I’ve also expanded the Habitability Requirements section of the Terraforming Wikipedia page, which you can find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraforming#Habitability_requirements" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br><br>
I’m a contributor to the Life Detection Knowledge Base: a repository for information about evidence for, and against, detections of signs of life. Find my work <a href="https://lifedetectionforum.com/hypothesis/crystal-alignment#off" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br><br>
      In summer 2023 I had the wonderful opportunity to travel to Sri Lanka for field research on serpentine deposits. We made it on local TV! Find the YouTube video capturing our work <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9nG4IzkAh0" target="_blank">here</a>. While traveling I also had the lovely chance to talk to students at a local village school in Ginigalpelessa about studying Mars and x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy.
